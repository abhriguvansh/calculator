# Realtime Calculator

## Objective

Create a web app using any language which logs calculations as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the app.

## What I Used

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
NodeJS
Express
Socket.io

## Bugs

Local server hosted on :3000 so although calculators can pull real time data, it is only if they are under the same localhost

When you enter a calculation, the result shows up multiple times

The result is displayed, as opposed to the entire operation

## How To Run

1. Download source files
2. Given node.js is installed, run 'npm install' in your terminal when you are in the root folder of the source code
3. Run 'node index.js'
4. Navigate to 'localhost:3000' to see calculator
